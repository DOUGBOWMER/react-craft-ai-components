## [0.0.28](https://github.com/craft-ai/react-craft-ai-components/compare/v0.0.27...v0.0.28) - 2020-01-28

## Fixed

- In the `DecisionTree` component, when selecting a node and changing the `data` prop, it unselects now the previous selected node.

## Added

- `DecisionTree` accepts `updateFoldedNodes` function as a prop. This latter is called when a new node is folded and passes the current folded nodes.

## [0.0.25](https://github.com/craft-ai/react-craft-ai-components/compare/v0.0.24...v0.0.25) - 2019-07-24

## Fixed

- The Decision tree now has a minimum height and weight to make sure it is always shown.
- `react-craft-ai-operations-history` has now a default estimated period between samples of 1.

- Nodes button are not moving when they are selected.

## [0.0.24](https://github.com/craft-ai/react-craft-ai-components/compare/v0.0.23...v0.0.24) - 2019-07-10

## Added

- Introduce a Decision Tree props `foldedNodes` to set which nodes' subtrees will be folded.

## Changed

- `DecisionTreeWithPanel` can now be provided by an initial `selectedNode`.

- `DecisionTreeWithPanel` & `DecisionTree` no longer require `width` and `height` to be dimensioned properly.
- The panel in `DecisionTreeWithPanel` now appears over the tree itself.

## Fixed

- Decision tree _fit-to-screen_ (when double clicking) now works with a single render and is therefore smoother.
- Decision tree selected node label offset is properly applied.
- Decision tree edges labels are now placed _more_ properly.
- Decision tree nodes that are not selectable no longer change the mouse pointer.
- Decision tree missing and optional branches are now well formatted.

## Removed

## Fixed

- The decision tree no longer relies on 'immutable'.
- Fixing the versions for React peer dependencies.
